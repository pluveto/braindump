Welcome to my Mathematics Obsidian Vault, a personal website where I maintain notes from my hobby study of (a very small pieces of) mathematics.

As a beginner learner, these notes are not intended to be authoritative. They simply represent my efforts to explore and understand mathematical concepts on my own. Any errors, omissions or inaccuracies in the content are entirely my own.

I share these notes here in the hopes they may benefit other students just starting out in their mathematical journey. However, please keep in mind the exploratory and amateur nature of the work. I welcome any *feedback* or corrections that could help improve my understanding.

I hope you find this site useful as you investigate mathematics. My goal is support independent exploration of this fascinating subject. Please enjoy browsing the collection and let me know if there are any ways I can make it more helpful to fellow learners.
