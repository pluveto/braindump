Welcome to my Obsidian Vault, a personal website where I maintain notes from my hobby study of (a very small pieces of) mathematics, computer science, programming lanuguages, etc.

As a beginner learner, these notes are not intended to be authoritative. They simply represent my efforts to explore and understand related concepts on my own. Any errors, omissions or inaccuracies in the content are entirely my own.

Wlcome any *feedback* or corrections that could help improve my understanding.
